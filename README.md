# Introduction
This project converts any GLTF looaded model into a particle system using threejs points material.

You can replace the model and change the camera animations to make your own scene.

Resources: [Threejs](https://threejs.org/), [WebGL](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/WebGL)


# Getting Started
Download and install Node.js on your computer (https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Then, open VSCODE, drag the project folder to it. Open VSCODE terminal and install dependencies (you need to do this only in the first time)
```

Run this command in your terminal to open a local server at localhost:8080
```
